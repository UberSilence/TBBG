# Turn Based Battle Game (TBBG)

Simple game concept made in C++ for console only.

## About the game

You'll have to battle with the bot, in turns. The first one to make a move is completely random. After that, you and the monster will take turns to attack each other.

## Features

* The game is random, there isn't one round like the other one.
* Level system: the monsters get stronger as you level up.
* Rank system: you'll be able to rank up based on your level.
* Coins (money) system: you'll get money after each round you win OR lose.
* Shop system: in case you can't beat the monster because he's too strong for you, there's a solution! Shop brings you a list of weapons and shield that will help you battle greater monsters and achieve better ranks.

## Compiling

You need to have *make* installed in order to compile it.
After that, just run the command in the main directory and you should be good to go.

```bash
make
```

## Running

Run the executable file that it creates after *make*.

```bash
.\game.exe
```

## Known bugs

* Sometimes the game is unbalanced.
